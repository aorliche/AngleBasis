# AngleBasis
A Generative Model and Decomposition for Functional Connectivity

We decompose FC into a compressed basis plus a residual.

We find the residual has greatly improved identifiability performance.

The ensemble of basis plus residual is superior in prediction compared to the original FC.

# To Run
Run the following command in the terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages
```

Then you are all set! Try the codes in the notebook directory:

```
cd notebooks
jupyter notebook
```

# Examples
